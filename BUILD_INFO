How to build Toxofone with Visual Studio 2015

1. In order to build Toxofone you need additional library libtox.dll

You can compile this library from github repository libtox-vs2015, or you can get it
from packed libtox distribution file libtox_x86_release.zip.

It need to unpack and copy libtox.dll into SharpTox subdirectory.

2. There are two solution files: Toxofone.sln and Toxofone-Portable.sln

First solution Toxofone.sln is a usual Visual Studio solution intended to develop/compile/debug.

Second solution Toxofone-Portable.sln is intended to build standalone executable with all depending libraries
embedded into single executable file.

To build portable version of Toxofone.exe open Toxofone-Portable.sln with Visual Studio 2015, 
make sure Toxofone-Portable project is set as StartUp project, choose Release configuration and run Rebuild.

After successful build you will see output directory <Toxofone>\Toxofone\bin\Portable-Release containing
Toxofone.exe

 Directory of <Toxofone>\Toxofone\bin\Portable-Release

This Toxofone.exe contains all managed and unmanaged libraries embedded as resources. On application startup, 
these libraries will be extracted from resources and attached to main application.
